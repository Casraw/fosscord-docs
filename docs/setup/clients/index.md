# Clients

!!! note "The {{ project.name }} client is, at the time of writing this (March 17th, 2023), under heavy development and not ready to be used in production just yet."

!!! warning "Windows support is currently broken."

The official {{ project.name }} client is currently being developed at [this repository]({{ repositories.base_url }}/{{ repositories.client }}/tree/dev/bare-rewrite).

## Official host

We currently host the client at [https://app.{{ project.domain }}](https://app.{{ project.domain }}).
You can use it to connect to our official instance by default,
or you can use it to connect to your own by editing your local storage to include the `routeSettings` key with the below example content:

```json
{
 "api":"https://staging.{{ project.domain }}/api/v9",
 "cdn":"https://cdn.staging.{{ project.domain }}",
 "gateway":"wss://gateway.staging.{{ project.domain }}",
 "invite":"https://staging.{{ project.domain }}/invite",
 "template":"https://staging.{{ project.domain }}/template",
 "gift":"https://staging.{{ project.domain }}/gift",
 "scheduledEvent":"https://staging.{{ project.domain }}/events"
}
```

Replace the above endpoints with your own. If your domain name is `https://whatever.notasite`, then you'll most likely want to enter
`https://whatever.noasite/api/v9` for the API endpoint, etc.

### What can I contribute?

- "Core" features like settings, editing messages, dms, markdown rendering, etc. What do you think are basic features that you would want? Some of the GitHub Issues apply to this.
- Implementing other things like voice/video is fine too, though
- [This]({{ repositories.base_url }}/{{ repositories.client }}/issues/21) is a good starting point and lists the core features that are still missing from the client.
